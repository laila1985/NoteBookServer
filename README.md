Only backEnd has been Implemented 

For the testing ==> PostMan 
The @PostMapping(path = "/execute", produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE) has been used to read data from body in json format

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.json</groupId>
			<artifactId>json</artifactId>
			<version>20180130</version>
		</dependency>

To process the python code the PythonInterpreter has been implemented and the following dependency has been included :
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.python</groupId>
			<artifactId>jython-standalone</artifactId>
			<version>2.7.1</version>
		</dependency>


To keep the state of the Python interpreter a file has been used to save the variable value from the previous request.

for the used spring boot I used the 2.0.3 because the 1.5.x doesn t accept the empty version and to have correct immplemetation of session in pom i need it empty. i couldn t find a compatible version with it:

<parent>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
		<!-- lookup parent from repository -->
		<!--version>1.5.19.RELEASE</version-->
		<version>2.0.3.RELEASE</version>
		<!-- This version doesn't accept dependency with empty version and to use session within spring boot  -->
		<!-- I need to add maven dependency without version that is why i have change it just to work on the last challenge else the project without session step is fine  -->
		<relativePath /> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->
	</parent>

The sessiosn has been implemented


What should happen if the piece of code cannot be parsed?
==> A pyton exception will be thrown

What should happen if the type of interpreter is not known?
==> Exception will be thrown to inform user that only python is implemented

What should happen if the interpreter takes a long time to finish?
==> no solution has been imlemented

The userâ€™s code can have side effects, so make sure that it is not executed multiple times.
What should happen if the python process encounters some kind of error?
==> if python encouters any issue a PytonExecutionException will be thrown

How to reliably test an application like this? Think about unit and integration testing.
==>Unit test has been imlplemented to check the process of different cases and that the exception is thrown.=>=NoteBookServerApplicationTests.java
The ExceptionHandlerControllerAdvice.java has been implemented to handle those exception.
